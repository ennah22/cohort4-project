## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

i took up this challenge because i have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

## The challenge

this challenge is to build on this portolio template and get it looking as i desire.
i used my basic understanding of what i have learnt so far in hertech trail academy.
## Building my project:
On the home page i gave a brief information about my self dropped some links to my social media platforms 
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page. Mostly i used css styling for giving it the colour and position the text and images and HTML also.

On the portfolio page, it was all about all projects i have worked on and people i have worked with. here i made use of botsrap card to take in all content about each project. 

on the About page i only wrote more content and added some pictures and the color becausei aleady loved thedisplay of how the about page was likewise the contact page.

## Where to find everything

You will find all the required assets used for this project in the /images folder and the pages to all other sites on the pages folder And Latly the index.html and css file outside in the main folder cohort4 project.

## Deploying my project

As mentioned above, there are a number of ways to host my project for free. But i used netflify as it's an amazing service and extremely simple to get set up with.


1. I Initialize my project as a public repository on GitHub. This will make it easier for me to shar code with the community if I need some help.
2. I Configured my repository to publish my code to a URL. This will also be useful if i need some help during a challenge as I can share the URL for my project with my repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, buh i used netlify

3. I Sign up to netlify and Went through the onboarding flow, ensuring my GitHub account is connected by using their netlify for GitHub integration.
4. I Connected my  project to netlify from the "Import project" page, using the "From Git Repository" button and selecting the project I want to deploy.
   Once connected, every time I git push, netlify will create a new deployment and the deployment URL will be shown on my Dashboard.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
